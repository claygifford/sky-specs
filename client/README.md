# SkySpecs Code Sample - Clay Gifford

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite.

An ideal code sample would include the following:
Consistently applied practices: approaches to things like naming and structuring should be the same across the entire body of work
Schema that we can see!
Non-trivial joins as critical parts of a larger feature
An API (ideally GraphQL) that allows users to interact with large or complex datasets
Modern development tools to build and deploy
Clear consideration for developer ergonomics through organization, documentation, and API design
